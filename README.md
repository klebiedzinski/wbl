# Włocławska Basket Liga

## Production

https://wbl.klebiedzinski.pl

## What is it?

- I made this app to learn the idea of Full Stack Development. At the same time, I wanted to create a tool that can be useful on daily basis.
- WBL is a basketball league in Włocławek. We're planning to use the app to manage the league and to make it easier for players to find all the information about it.
- It's a simple app with a lot of room for improvments. (better security, better UI, etc.)
